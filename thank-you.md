title: Thank you!
---

During the development of my life and career I met people who made huge
contributions to what I became today.
Some taught me things, others helped with mentoring, advising or just friendship
itself, but their contributions were really important to me.

This page is a simple **Thank you! <3** message to them.

- **Joel and Marlenuvia Souza**  
  My real grandparents. I just would never had a chance without their support.

- **Carlos Alberto Brocco**  


- **Julio Farias**  
  Old friend! We met during my first experience with Web development (not a good
  one at all). We became coworkers some time later, when I learned the basics
  of programming and turned into a Flash/ActionScript developer.

- **Ticiana de Souza**  
  Aunt. Friend. Family.

- **Tereza Jucá**  
  Two years supporting a annoying teenager was not easy! But that time were so
  important to the first steps of my career!
  During that time I had my first experiences with Web development, as
  maintainer of my school's website.

- **Márcio Brasil**  
  One of my very first employers. I was a real newbie when I came to work at
  MBrasil, and that opportunity turned into one of the most importants of my
  life.
  Working at MBrasil with Márcio, Julio and Robert, the superstar team that
  brought so many incredible projects to reality, was a great experience!
  I'm really grateful for that opportunity, as well as all lessons - including
  the ones about relational databases and SQL. :-P

- **Robert Adão**  
  A joker that trolled me for months! But the Photoshop techniques I learned
  from him couldn't be found somewhere else.

- **Leonardo Silva**  
  A friend from the Drupal community. The first big projects with Drupal  were
  by his invites. Also, an admirable person and an incredible musician!
